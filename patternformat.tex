\section{The Patterns}

%Leo: 1st paragraph to intro
%Leo: Separate sections per pattern?
In this paper we present three software architecture patterns for system administration support: 
%Unknown1: The origin of these patterns? Mainly if they are specialisations of exising ones?
\begin{itemize} 
	\item {\sc Administration API}
	\item {\sc Single File Location and Structure}
	\item {\sc Centralized System Logging}
%	\item {\sc Centralized Identity Management}
%	\item {\sc Multi-Tenant Application}
\end{itemize}

The patterns use a version of the Alexandrian pattern format, as described in \cite{alexander1977}. The first part of each pattern is a short description of the context, followed by three diamonds. In the second part, the problem (in bold) and the forces are described, followed by another three diamonds. The third part offers the solution (again in bold), consequences of the pattern application --- which are part of the resulting context --- and a discussion of possible implementations. In the final part of each pattern, shown in \textit{italics}, we discuss related patterns and offer a rationale for the pattern based on literature.
