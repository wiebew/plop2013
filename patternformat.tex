\section{The Patterns}

In this paper we present the first three software architecture patterns for system administration support: 
\begin{itemize} 
	\item {\sc Administration API}
	\item {\sc Single File Location and Structure}
	\item {\sc Built-in System Logging}
%	\item {\sc Centralized Identity Management}
%	\item {\sc Multi-Tenant Application}
\end{itemize}

The patterns use a version of the Alexandrian pattern format, as described in \cite{alexander1977}. The first part of each pattern is a short description of the context, followed by three diamonds. In the second part, the problem (in bold) and the forces are described, followed by another three diamonds. The third part offers the solution (again in bold), consequences of the pattern application --- which are part of the resulting context --- and a discussion of possible implementations. In the final part of each pattern, shown in \textit{italics}, we discuss related patterns and offer a rationale for the pattern based on literature.
