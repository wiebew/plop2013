abstract = {The second of three books published by the Center for Environmental Structure to provide a "working alternative to our present ideas about architecture, building, and planning," A Pattern Language offers a practical language for building and planning based on natural considerations. The reader is given an overview of some 250 patterns that are the units of this language, each consisting of a design problem, discussion, illustration, and solution. By understanding recurrent design problems in our environment, readers can identify extant patterns in their own design projects and use these patterns to create a language of their own. Extraordinarily thorough, coherent, and accessible, this book has become a bible for homebuilders, contractors, and developers who care about creating healthy, high-level design. "Brilliant....Here's how to design or redesign any space you're living or working in--from metropolis to room. Consider what you want to happen in the space, and then page through this book. Its radically conservative observations will spark, enhance, organize your best ideas, and a wondrous home, workplace, town will result"--San Francisco Chronicle. A handbook designed for the layman which aims to present a language which people can use to express themselves in their own communities or homes, and to better communicate with each other.},
annote = {Alexander himself, in his seminal book (Alexander et al, 1978), describes a pattern called Network of Learning. The premise of this pattern is that in a society which emphasises teaching, learners become passive and unable to think or act for themselves. He argues that creative, active individuals can only grow up in a society which emphasises learning instead of teaching. The solution he proposes is to replace the structures of compulsory schooling in a fixed place, with decentralised processed of learning which engage learners through contact with many places and people all over the city: workshops, teachers at home, professionals will to take on the young as helpers, older children, museums, youth groups, scholarly seminars, industrial workshops, old people, and so on. This argument resonates with Ilich's call for deschooling society (1971) and conviviality (1973). ---=note-separator=--- in Syverson, 98 http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/\~{}syverson/papers/vwsim98.html "Every creative act relies on language. It is not only those creative acts which are part of a traditional society which rely on language: all creative acts rely on pattern languages: the fumbling inexperienced constructions of a novice are made within the language which he has. The works of idiosyncratic genius are also created within some part of language too. And the most ordinary roads and bridges are all built within a language too.... In order to make patterns explicit, so that they can be shared in this new way, we must first of all review the very complex structure of a pattern.... As an element in the world, each pattern is a relationship between a certain context, a certain system of forces which occurs repeatedly in that context, and a certain spatial configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves. ... As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this spatial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant." (Alexander et al. 1977) ---=note-separator=--- "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."},

In particular, we have in mind developers, testers, systems and database administrators, and managers. We cover topics from traditional configuration management, source code control, release planning, auditing, compliance, and integration to the automation of your building, testing, and deployment processes. We also describe techniques such as automated acceptance testing, dependency management, database migration, and the creation and management of testing and production environments. Many people involved in creating software consider these activities secondary to writing code. However, in our experience they take up a great deal of time and effort, and are critical to successful software delivery. When the risks surrounding these activities are not managed adequately, they can end up costing a lot of money, often more than the cost of building the software in the first place.},

@book{Polimeni2008,
abstract = {Build more roads and congestion goes up, not down; improve engine efficiency and people drive more, increasing (as opposed to decreasing) emissions these are examples of Jevons' Paradox, and clearly illustrate its importance in modern debates around resource use From an international team of researchers, this is the first book to tackle the issues head-on with special focus on the case of oil usage Will be an essential addition to any economics, energy or resource management departmental bookshelf 'Jevons' Paradox', which was first expressed in 1865 by William Stanley Jevons in relation to use of coal, states that an increase in efficiency in using a resource leads to increased use of that resource rather than to a reduction. This has subsequently been proved to apply not just to fossil fuels, but other resource use scenarios. For example, doubling the efficiency of food production per hectare over the last 50 years (due to the Green Revolution) did not solve the problem of hunger. The increase in efficiency increased production and worsened hunger because of the resulting increase in population. The implications of this in today's world are substantial. Many scientists and policy makers argue that future technological innovations will reduce consumption of resources; Jevons' Paradox explains why this may be a false hope. This is the first book to provide a historical overview of Jevons' Paradox, provide evidence for its existence and apply it to complex systems. Written and edited by world experts in the fields of economics, technology and the environment, it explains the myth of efficiency and explores its implications for resource usage (particularly oil). It is a must read for policy makers, natural resource managers, academics and students concerned with the effects of efficiency on resource use.},
